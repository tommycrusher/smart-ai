# Smart AI VS Code Extension

This is the Smart AI VS Code Extension. Its primary jobs are

1. Implement the IDE side of the Smart AI IDE protocol, allowing a Smart AI server to interact natively in an IDE. This happens in `src/continueIdeClient.ts`.
2. Open the Smart AI React app in a side panel. The React app's source code lives in the `gui` directory. The panel is opened by the `smartai.openContinueGUI` command, as defined in `src/commands.ts`.

# How to run the extension
